# Snake game 🐍🎮

##### In the game, the player controls a long, thin, snake-like creature that wanders around a delimited plane, collecting food, trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the "walls" surrounding the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, the tail grows longer, causing the difficulty of the game to increase. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left or right) and the snake's body follows. In addition, the player cannot stop the snake's movement while the game is in progress.
